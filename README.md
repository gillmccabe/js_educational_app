# JS Educational App

A week-long group project created using JS, Google Maps API, our own custom API and MongoDB.
Our initial brief was to create an interactive educational web app that displays information in a fun and interesting way.  

From this brief we designed, planned and developed a web app which displays the spread of infectious diseases across the world over several centuries and provides the user with facts about each disease. 


## Our MVP

- Should be able to select a disease from a list of diseases
- Upon selecting a disease, markers should be placed on the map to show where the disease is prevalent
- Should be able to add more than one disease to the map at once
- On clicking on a map marker, an info-window should pop up to provide information about that disease
