    comment: "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that infects the immune system, decreasing its ability to fight off other infections and diseases. The first known human to become infected with HIV was a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo whose blood was collected and tested in 1959. Scientists believe the first human infection may have occurred in the late 1940s or early 50s.",

    comment: "As of 2013, there were 35.0 million people living with HIV around the globe, up from 29.8 million in 2001. Scientists attribute these staggering HIV statistics to new infections, but also to general population growth and the fact that research and treatments have allowed those with HIV to live longer lives.",

    comment: "In 1988, DC Comics introduced a villain named “Hemo-Goblin.” The HIV-positive vampire was created by a group of white supremacists and used to infect minorities. Not surprisingly, Hemo-Goblin wasn’t much of a fan favorite and the character appeared in only one issue of The New Guardians.",

    comment: "Two strains of HIV have been identified: HIV-1 (from the Central Common Chimpanzee) and HIV-2 (from the Sooty Mangabey monkey). HIV-1 is more virulent, more easily transmitted, and is the cause of the vast majority of global HIV infections. HIV-2 is harder to transmit and is mainly confined to West Africa.",
